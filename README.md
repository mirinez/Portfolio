## ✧ About the Project 

This portfolio was designed as a clean 🍀, editorial-style layout focused on typography, whitespace, and structural clarity.

It follows a split-section layout pattern:
- Left column for section labels.
- Right column for structured content.

The goal was to create something calm, intentional, and readable — not overloaded.

## ✧ Design Decisions

- Serif font for titles to create an editorial voice.

- Consistent spacing rhythm across sections.

The emphasis is on structure and intentional simplicity.
